### What You'll Get:

#### ✅ **Gemma3n Integration:**
- **Your responses will come from YOUR Gemma3n model**
- Much more natural and varied conversations
- Better context understanding
- Personalized, empathetic responses

#### ✅ **Enhanced Emotion Detection:**
- **"I can see you're looking a little sad. What happened? Please share with me."**
- **"You're looking bright and happy today! That's wonderful to see."**
- **"I notice you seem upset or frustrated. I'm here to listen."**

#### ✅ **Automatic Camera Switching:**
- **Hello/Greeting** → Front camera (emotion detection)
- **"What do you see"** → Back camera (scene description)  
- **"I feel sad"** → Front camera (emotion analysis)
- **"Look around"** → Back camera (environment scan)

#### ✅ **Conversational Scene Description:**
- **"The environment appears well-lit. There is one person in view who appears to be happy."**
- **"I can see someone standing with a smiling face."**
- **"There are 2 people in the room, one looks concerned."**

### Example Conversation Flow:

**You:** "Hello, my name is Priya"
**App:** Uses front camera → "Hello Priya! Nice to meet you! I can see you're looking bright and engaged today. How are you feeling?"

**You:** "I'm feeling a bit sad today"  
**App:** Uses front camera → "I can see you're looking a little sad. What happened? Please share with me. I'm here to listen and support you."

**You:** "What do you see around me?"
**App:** Uses back camera → "The environment appears well-lit with greenery visible. There is one person in view who appears to be thoughtful."

### Technical Details:

**Your Code Configuration:**
```python
# In app/__init__.py - This will connect to YOUR Ollama
"model": "gemma3n",
"prompt": f"You are a caring AI companion for blind users. A user named {user_name} just said: \"{user_text}\". Respond with empathy and support in 2-3 sentences."
```

**Automatic Camera Logic:**
- Emotion keywords → Front camera
- Scene keywords → Back camera
