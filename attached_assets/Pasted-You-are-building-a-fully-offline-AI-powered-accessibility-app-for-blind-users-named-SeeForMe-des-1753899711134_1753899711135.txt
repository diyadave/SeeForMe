You are building a fully offline AI-powered accessibility app for blind users, named "SeeForMe", designed to provide emotional support, real-time scene awareness, and natural voice interaction — all without needing an internet connection. This smart assistant uses camera-based emotion detection, multi-language voice recognition (English, Hindi, Gujarati), text-to-speech, YOLO object detection, scene recognition using Places365, and Gemma 3n-based natural conversation to help visually impaired users understand their surroundings and feel emotionally supported. You’re developing this as part of your journey to master AI and machine learning and to participate in the Kaggle Gemma 3n Impact Challenge, where you aim to prove how a large language model like Gemma can be applied in a meaningful real-world application that solves accessibility and mental health problems for vulnerable users. The app should open with a sleek purple-blue animated voice assistant UI, auto-start the front or back camera, detect the user's emotion, and respond with empathy or motivational messages. When a user asks "what's around me?", the app should switch to the back camera, describe the scene using Places365, detect objects via YOLOv8, and respond intelligently. All of this must run offline, using Vosk for voice recognition and ONNX/TFLite for fast local inference, except for fallback text-to-speech in Indian languages if needed. However, you are currently facing multiple technical issues: emotion detection is not implemented yet, voice recognition using Vosk does not trigger or detect input properly, Gemma integration often times out or gives no response, and TTS errors like "run loop already started" occur after a few interactions. Despite having a solid modular architecture with Flask, SocketIO, threading, and camera switching, the app’s smart assistant features are not fully functional yet, and only the UI and camera are reliably working. You're working hard to fix these bugs one by one and make your vision real — a smooth, real-time, intelligent companion for blind users that can talk, support, and guide them completely offline, just like a friend.
