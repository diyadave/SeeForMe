## Gemma3n Nano Model Configuration

Your app is now configured to use **Gemma3n nano model** - perfect for mobile phones!

### Current Setup:
```python
# In app/__init__.py - Configured for Gemma3n nano
"model": "gemma3n",
"prompt": f"You are a caring AI companion for blind users. A user named {user_name} just said: \"{user_text}\". Respond with empathy and support in 2-3 sentences."
```

### Why Gemma3n Nano is Perfect for Mobile:
- **Small size**: Optimized for mobile devices with limited resources
- **Fast responses**: Quick inference on phone hardware
- **Offline operation**: No internet required once installed
- **Low battery usage**: Efficient processing for longer usage

## Mobile App Architecture

### Core Components Ready:
1. **`kivy_mobile_app.py`** - Main mobile interface
2. **Flask backend** - Embedded server with SocketIO
3. **Voice recognition** - Continuous speech processing
4. **Text-to-speech** - Android/iOS compatible TTS
5. **AI processing** - Gemma3n nano + pattern matching fallback

### Deployment Process:

#### For Android APK:
```bash
# 1. Configure buildozer
buildozer init

# 2. Build APK
buildozer android debug

# 3. Install on phone
adb install bin/SeeForMe-debug.apk
```

#### For iOS:
```bash
# 1. Use kivy-ios
pip install kivy-ios
toolchain build python3 kivy

# 2. Create Xcode project
toolchain create SeeForMe /path/to/app

# 3. Build in Xcode for App Store
```

## Mobile-Specific Features

### Camera Integration (Ready to Add):

- Back camera: Scene description with YOLOv8n
- Auto-switching based on conversation context

### Voice Processing:
- Android: SpeechRecognizer API
- iOS: Speech framework
- Offline TTS: Android TextToSpeech, iOS AVSpeechSynthesizer

### Storage Strategy:
- **Models**: Bundle Gemma3n, emotion.onnx, yolov8n.onnx with APK
- **Voice cache**: Local TTS audio caching
- **User data**: Encrypted local storage for conversation history

## Next Steps for Mobile Distribution:

1. **Test Current Features** - Everything is working perfectly in web version
2. **Package for Mobile** - Use buildozer to create APK with Gemma3n
3. **Distribute to Phones** - Install on multiple devices as requested
4. **Add Vision Features** - Camera integration for complete experience
